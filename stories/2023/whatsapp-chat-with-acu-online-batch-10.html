                    <p>My Pranam to each and every member of the Sangha
10/11/23, 9:16 pm - +1 (905) 484-5000: very profound class today from heart (physical) to heart (emotional). We are blessed to know you.
10/11/23, 9:23 pm - +91 99378 66044: Das Babu I went to your office last Sunday to bring the books. That day was a meeting of other members. As I am staying at Bhubaneswar I want to go there next week with two patients one with gastric problem since more than 10 years and another with spondylitis problem. I have maximum time tooth problem. So which point to be treated.
10/11/23, 9:24 pm - +33 6 99 09 47 99: I feel exactly the same
10/11/23, 9:24 pm - +1 (905) 484-5000: Want to share my story, I am from Canada, being a physiotherapist working in health care for over 20 years now . when I moved here, I saw the entire health care system and their approach so reactive and there was no respect for traditional knowledge what so ever.</p>
                    <p>Also being a yoga teacher, I was appalled at how the yoga was commercialized in the west. After seeing so much pain and suffering in my patients, I started using yoga, pranayama and dhyaan techniques in all my patients. With very positive results esp. with chronic pain conditions.</p>
                    <p>A few years back I started this organization called Mokshadham Foundation, as a non-profit to spread the true knowledge of yoga without any fee structure to combat the high cost of yoga studios here. Most of our classes are online and have done multiple free online camps benefitting thousands of adults and children around the globe 🌏 .</p>
                    <p>My dream is to make yoga accessible and affordable to all around the world and help people with their pain and suffering.</p>
                    <p>Todays session brought tears to my eyes when I see you doing this for 30 years. Kudos to all organizer. Thank you so much!!!
10/11/23, 9:36 pm - +91 87906 55762: Sir today&#x27;s class was so deep and I felt I am lucky to be here when I planned to do some healing work as a huve back to the society ..I will definitely contribute from my side its an oath .but we need further training and help from you .pl be with us sir 🙏.

                    <p>In Visakhapatnam, we are 4 therapists who have made a humble start under guidance of a social worker. All things start small.....</p>
                    <p>By doing the workbooks we can gain expertise in memorising the points. Then practice on ourselves and migrate to family members, maids etc
10/11/23, 9:57 pm - +1 (630) 728-9379: I request all of us who took this class to be together as a group via telegram or what’s app so that we can keep in touch .
Know how we are all using our self in applying the knowledge .
10/11/23, 9:58 pm - +91 98957 42704: I too am truly blessed to be in this class sir.As you said it is not we who have come to learn this science,it is an unknown power or destiny that has brought us here. 
 I am practicing alternative therapy since 2019 but have been into it fulltime after having retired from government services since last November. I am so happy to have learnt this therapy from such a humble,down to earth person like you who just pours out knowledge selflessly. I will learn this therapy and will try to help the needy through it...and I am confident that we will get all the support needed from your organisation.May lord bless you to spread your knowledge and service to more and more people...🙏.I am indebted to Kuttappan sir Roll no 1 of this batch for introducing me to you and the organization.

12/11/23, 3:15 pm - +91 99378 66044: Sir, I want to give a proposal to conduct training class in SRI SRI UNIVERSITY,Cuttack. There is Ayurvedic medical College and Austeopathic undergraduate, integrated courses. If required I can talk with VC and Director of SSU .
12/11/23, 4:11 pm - Soumitra Accupressure: Since 2015 or 2016 our organisation is in constant touch with the Yoga department of SSU and was conducting training prog for the Yoga students. But this was on private initiative by the students.
But last year it was added in the syllabus of Yoga and our organisation taught Acu Reflexology and Meridianology in two semesters.
This year the department contacted us to take the classes but then they didn&#x27;t take it forward.
In fact the Dean Mr. Trithankar Ghosh discussed with me regarding inclusion of Acupressure in the Osteopathy syllabus but it didn&#x27;t move forward.</p>
                    <p>There is a lot in SSU both staff and faculties who have taken this training at SSU.</p>
                    <p>By the way thanks for the proposal and will be very happy to make people learn Acupressure in any forum.
12/11/23, 4:41 pm - +91 95202 07433: I too am an SSU graduate (MA Yoga 2016-18 batch) and was introduced to Acupressure by sir through Orissa Swasthya Seva Sangh.</p>
                    <p>Students at SSU have greatly benefited from these workshops and will continue to do so in the future.
12/11/23, 4:51 pm - +91 99378 66044: Thank you Sir. I didn&#x27;t know your past involvement. During Guruji &#x27;s visit on 8th and 9th Nov there were 15 MOUs signed by different organisations. Let&#x27;s try for similar type MOU with SSU. I shall talk with the Dean for this.
12/11/23, 5:08 pm - Soumitra Accupressure: Yeah the Yoga department even thought of signing MOU with our organisation but that didn&#x27;t even move forward. 
It would really be a great thing if you can help in this direction.
Thanks.
12/11/23, 6:12 pm - +91 98957 42704: Sir can alopecia be reversed with acupressure....it is for a 11 year old boy.

From tomorrow one offline training is going to start and we will travel to another city to conduct this session.
After starting the session I will answer all the pending questions and will share the slides of the last day session.
15/11/23, 2:27 pm - deepali manthina: Dear Batchmates,
I have repeated the acupressure class and am feeling a wee bit confident about the 39 points. I handled 3-4 cases though not regularly. Personally found magical results for sprained shoulder, sprained left knee, stiff neck. Just yesterday pressed points 1,2, 6,7,16,30,31,33,34 on my maids hands as she was having cold and throat trouble. She felt so happy and immediately felt lightness in sinus area near eyebrows.</p>
                    <p>Reason I am discussing all this is because I sense a nervousness amongst few Batchmates---in terms of memorising 39 points; leave alone practicing them.</p>
                    <p>Hence would like to share one tip - - - don&#x27;t get nervous about exam. Exam is so that we study. Now, many of us have crossed the stage of academics so feel nervous.
no worries. 
But whenever anyone wants help in treating oneself or others, immediately reach out to ask the point numbers. And then press those for relief. Please don&#x27;t get overwhelmed. In offline class learning the practicals is conducive and easier. Fortunately, Sir has sent short videos of all 39 points. So the exact location and method of pressing can be referred from the videos and treatment can be pursued.</p>
                    <p>Please don&#x27;t get overwhelmed.
Just remember one thing - - do not abandon this magical technique on account of not being able to memorise points.
From time to time, Please turn the pages of main book minimum of 3-4 times in a week. Keep book close by and go through one paragraph at least.</p>
                    <p>Sir and his team are always a WA msg away in times of need.</p>
                    <p>All the best!
15/11/23, 2:41 pm - +91 94901 32993: Thank you very much Deepalu madam
15/11/23, 2:47 pm - +91 94901 32993: I am able to identify the points but forgetting the name
15/11/23, 2:48 pm - +91 94901 32993: I don&#x27;t know what i will do in the exam😔

15/11/23, 8:34 pm - deepali manthina: Wow
15/11/23, 9:17 pm - +1 (630) 728-9379: Sir 
Our exam is fast approaching .
The material is extensive and I am trying to coordinate the learning process .
The class time was structured in introducing the human anatomy .
The points and various disease in correlation to the anatomy has to be studied now .
It is vast and taking time .</p>
                    <p>I do not want the exam to be an impediment in the learning process .
This is a new field to comprehend and is taking time .
Personally for me one week of self study time to this subject seems too less as it is very new .
I would like to take this exam the next time you give it to the next batch or may be in a month . 
I require the time to grasp this material without developing an aversion to it out of anxiety .
This is my pattern of learning in a methodical manner with retention ability .
I have invested the time to know this subject and the self study will take time as it is a hands on method which I have to study on my own .
This is a request to postpone my exam for a future date .
Thanks
15/11/23, 9:19 pm - +1 (905) 484-5000: I am also in a similar situation, can the exam be postponed?
15/11/23, 9:19 pm - +1 (905) 484-5000: There is lot of material to cover
15/11/23, 9:19 pm - +33 6 99 09 47 99: I would also like to have a couple more weeks to study, if possible!
15/11/23, 9:19 pm - +1 (630) 728-9379: I was not well during the class and some of rhe points mentioned thru advise from Leena ji and Deepali helped me a lot .
Hence I will use it for myself and others after studying it well first
16/11/23, 3:19 am - +91 94901 32993: Even I am in the same situation, the subject is entirely new to me, and time is very short, can the exam be postponed ?
16/11/23, 7:56 am - +91 94964 62431: Same here...
16/11/23, 10:56 am - +91 96198 64953: Me too not keeping well, Sunday family marriage function in the evening, and also Festival season busy with guest. Kindly postponed for next month .🙏
