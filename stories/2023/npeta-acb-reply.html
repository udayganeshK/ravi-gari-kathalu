                    <p>Sir,</p>
                    <p>Subject : Public Servants -Revenue Department - Allegations of corruption against former Tahsildar of Narsanapeta Mandal and other revenue officials Srikakulam- Regular enquiry conducted -explanation called for regarding..</p>
                    <p>Ref: No 68/RE-VSK/2020/S-12 O/o Director General Anti Corruption Bureau- Andhra Pradesh Vijayawada dated 12- 8- 2020.
 ***</p>
                    <p>Sir,</p>
                    <p>I invite your attention to the reference cited.</p>
                    <p>In the reference cited, it is informed that DSP ACB Srikakulam range, is conducting an enquiry into the complaint made to the Government of Andhra Pradesh that the former Tahsildars of Narsanapeta Mandal Srikakulam District have indulged in corruption,which resulted in the encroachment of valuable government lands in Gotipalli, Borigivalasa and Satyavaram Revenue villages of Narsanapeta Mandal, and the Tahsildars did not take any action, on the encroachments,by accepting bribes during their tenure as Tahsildar Narsanapeta Mandal
Srikakulam district.</p>
                    <p>Names of 9 such encroachers were also furnished and I&#x27;m asked to submit my explanation on the allegations referred above.</p>
                    <p>In this connection I submit that I am posted as Tahsildar Narsanapeta Mandal in month of March 2012 consequent of announcement of Bye election to to Narasannapeta Assembly Constituency and I am appointed, as the Assistant Returning Officer Headquarters to conduct the elections.</p>
                    <p>I asumed the charge of Tahsildar Narsanapeta on 1-4- 2012 and soon after assuming the charge I attended to 
the inspection of polling Booths, creation of new polling booths in more than 250 polling stations in Narasannapeta Mandal.</p>
                    <p>I, being the headquarters Assistant Returning Officer had also attended,the statutory duties pertaining to receipt of nomination papers scrutiny of nominations,and publication of list of Contesting Candidates.</p>
                    <p>Several Election Officials have visited Narsannapeta Mandal during the election period and I have followed them during their tour to apprise them about the various arrangements made with regard to obtaining polling material,conduct of training classes to the Polling personnel,arranging and distribution of polling material, randomisation of EVMS, Distribution of material two days before Election,reception duties after completion of elections and storing of Ballot Papers in the strong rooms, and made arrangements for counting of votes, and on the day of counting,sent the Result Sheet to the Election Commission of India and finalising the accounts of election.</p>
                    <p>In regard to the allegation, that encroachments were allowed in Government lands during my tenure by taking bribes is absolutely baseless, as the entire Mandal staff were totally engaged in election work.</p>
                    <p>During the village Revenue officers meetings
held during my tenure the Village Revenue officers were always directed, to detect the unlawful encroachments in Government lands and they were directed to remove the encroachments as per encroachment Act and Rules.</p>
                    <p>The Revenue Inspectors were also directed, during the meetings to conduct physical verification of encroachments and report encroachments of any to the Office for necessary action.</p>
                    <p>I worked as Tahsildar Narasannapeta from 1-4-2012 to 9-7-2012 i e.,for a period of 3 months and 7days, and soon after the completion of elections, I was transferred to Visakhapatnam District by the Government.</p>
                    <p>I submit that, there is no willful negligence on my part in stopping the irregular encroachments and it is totally baseless and incorrect that bribes were taken and encroachments were ignored.</p>
                    <p>My tenure as Tahsildar Narsanapeta mostly spent on election work which took precedence over regular revenue duties.</p>
                    <p>This is submitted for favor of kind information.</p>
                    <p>Yours faithfully
KVS RAVI</p>
