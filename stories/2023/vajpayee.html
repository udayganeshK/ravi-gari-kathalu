                    <p>Atal Bihari Vajpayee was very perturbed with frequently changing governments at the Centre. Four governments had been sworn in between 1996 and 1998 including two led by Vajpayee himself.</p>
                    <p>Vajpayee considered this trend as damaging for the progress of India. He believed that &quot;a strong Centre&quot; was necessary to keep India&#x27;s economic wellbeing on track.</p>
                    <p>The United Front coalition was not doing well politically, and this had left Vajpayee worried about the prospects of the country as a whole. The India story that had begun in 1991 was said to be dying a premature death. Vajpayee wanted to keep India story and hope alive.</p>
                    <p>Vajpayee had a &quot;very good opinion&quot; about Manmohan Singh. Vajpayee sent a message to Manmohan Singh. Vajpayee&#x27;s message to Manmohan Singh was simple yet politically unthinkable:</p>
                    <p>“The BJP is ready to support a Congress government at the Centre if it chooses Manmohan Singh as its leader.”</p>
                    <p>Simply put, Vajpayee was ready to support Manmohan Singh government of the Congress for stability of India.</p>
                    <p>Politicians who themselves are ambitious to run &amp; govern and be at the helm of the affairs making a proposal of support for the sake of the nation…is truly unthinkable and unimaginable.</p>
                    <p>Also, it “reveals the maturity and professional excellence of a patriotic statesman who believed that the nation is bigger than the political system”. Most mature and patriotic politicians India could ever have, they placed nation before politics and were truly concerned about India’s economy.</p>
