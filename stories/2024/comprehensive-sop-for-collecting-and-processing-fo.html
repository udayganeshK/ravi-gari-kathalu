 • Priority on treating life-threatening injuries before collecting evidence
 • Informed consent from SAS is necessary for forensic examination
Promptness in Examination
 • Timely examination is essential for quality forensic evidence
 • Optimal time for DNA evidence collection is within 72 hours of assault
 • Date and time of examination must be clearly documented
Collection of Samples
 • SAEC kits should be available at all hospitals and police stations
 • Detailed history of assault and post-assault activities must be documented
 • Clothing worn during assault should be collected, preserved, and sealed
Collection of Blood and Urine Samples
 • Blood samples for HIV, VDRL, HBsAg testing and comparison with stains
 • Blood and urine samples for drug and alcohol detection
 • Proper collection and storage of blood and urine samples
Genital and Anal Evidence
 • Collection of pubic hair, swabs from vulva, vagina, and anal opening
 • Vaginal smears for seminal fluid examination
 • Vaginal washing collection using a sterilized syringe and catheter
Handing over samples to FSL
 • Requisition letter to FSL detailing samples and tests needed
 • Letter signed by examining doctor and police personnel
 • Proper labeling, air-drying, and sealing of samples before handing over
General
 • Air drying and proper labeling of samples is crucial
 • Moistening swab sticks with distilled water for sample collection
