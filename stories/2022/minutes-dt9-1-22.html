                    <p>Minutes of the General Body Meeting of the Rushikonda Plot Allottees Welfare Society sVisakhapatnam held on 9-1-2022 in Rushikonda Visakhapatnam.</p>
                    <p>****</p>
                    <p>The Annual General Body Meeting of the Rushikonda Plot Allottees Welfare Society Visakhapatnam was held on 9-1-2022 in the house premises of Sri M.Rami Reddy garu one of the allottes in Rushikonda Township.</p>
                    <p>The Founder President of the Society Sri M.Gandhi Reddy in his inaugural address has welcomed the members present and stated that the General Body of the Society could not meet in the last two years due to covid situation.</p>
                    <p>He stated that two senior members and Officer Bearers of the Society Sarvasri ……… have passed away during the pandemic and the members present have observed two minutes of silence in memory of the departed members.</p>
                    <p>The president has informed that Sri KVS Ravi and Sri M.Vijayananda Kumar members of the Society have been inducted into the executive body as vice president and joint secretary and welcomed them to the dais. The members present have welcomed the new office bearers with claps.</p>
                    <p>Sri KVS Ravi, and Sri M,Vijananda Kumar have thanked the members present for inducting them into the Executive Body.</p>
                    <p>Sri M.Gandhi Reddy President has requested Sri M.Vijayanand Kumar Joint Secretary to read out the financial statement of the Society for the year 2021-22 duly audited by the Auditor and the copies of the statement were circulated to the members and they have approved the financial statement. The president has explained the funds position of the society.</p>
                    <p>The President has stated that due to the Corona Pandemic situation not much activity could not be done for the last two years, but the Society was successful in averting road expansion plans of VMRDA.</p>
                    <p>Sri KVS Ravi, Vice President has explained the members that the VMRDA has proposed expansion of two roads in S.Nos 333 and 334 in the layout in their proposed Master Plan 2041 as follows:</p>
                    <p>S.NO. 333 from 60 feet road to 120 feet and in S.No.334 from 80 feet to 150 feet,.</p>
                    <p>Sensing the huge damage to the plot owners, Sri M.Gandhi Reddy Garu and Senior Member Sri Ramireddy Garu with the technical assistance of Sri M.Vijayananda Kumar have represented the matter to the VMRDA, that proposed expansion of roads is unjust and pursued the matter with VMRDA.</p>
                    <p>It is heartening to inform that VMRDA has took cognizance of our representation and have since dropped the expansion of the road in S.No.333 and have reduced the proposed road expansion in S.No.334 from 150 feet to 100 feet only,</p>
                    <p>Smt Satyavathi member present has asked about park development and Smt. Y.Manjula Member present has complained about a junction box set up by the APEPDCL authorities in the middle of their Plot.</p>
                    <p>The President explained that in regard to park development, much headway could not be made with the VMRDA due to the Pandemic situation and that it will be pursued once normalcy is restored. In regard to the representation of Smt Y.Manjula he stated that a written representation may be given to the Society to pursue with concerned authorities.</p>
                    <p>Dwelling on other matters the President stated that the present membership of the society stood at 104 and encouraged the members to become life members by paying 8000/- He stated that due to current inflationary trends the life membership fee may have to be increased and hence requested the members cooperate in this regard.</p>
                    <p>At the end of the meeting one of the members present suggested that a site map may be erected in the middle of the layout for easy identification of plots and it is decided to take an estimate to erect such a site map.</p>
                    <p>Prof. M.Ramireddy Garu, Senior Member of the Society has impressed about the collective action of all members in resolving the problems of the Society.</p>
                    <p>The president has requested the members for their active participation in the activities of the society, and thanked the members present and concluded the General Body. s</p>
