                    <p>Madam,
 Sub:- General Administration - Vigilance and Enforcement Department- 
 Visakhapatnam Unit- Videsh Vidya Dhan Scheme for Kapu Students Request to furnish the verification details of certain students, while issuing
 Income Certificates- Furnishing of required Point Wise Information -Reg</p>
                    <p>Ref:- Your Letter Rc 1173/ RV CEO-VSP/10P-3/2021 Dated 30-6-2022 received
 On 14-9-2022 through Whatsapp received from the Circle Inspector V&amp;E
 Visakhapatnam.
 ***</p>
                    <p>I invite your attention to the reference cited.</p>
                    <p>With reference to your letter cited, I furnish herewith the point wise information called for on the subject matter.</p>
                    <p>I am to state that in the reference cited a copy of the Income Certificate issued to Sri 
Moturu Mahalakshmi Naidu Father of Harish by me in the capacity of Tahsildar Gajuwaka with Income Certificate bearing Number AP111610174 Dated 5-4-2017 was sent to me,and it was informed that your Department has conducted enquiries on the Income Certificates obtained by certain Students under Videsh Vidya Dhan Scheme offered by Kapu Corporation Andhra Pradesh and your enquiries revealed that the Annual Income of the Sri Moturu Mahalakshmi Naidu Father of Harish is more than Six Lakhs per annum as per the IT returns filed by him and that Income Certificate issued from the Office is erroneous and hence point wise information was sought from me on 3 points.</p>
                    <p>I furnish hereunder the point wise information sought for in the reference cited.</p>
                    <p>Point No.1. I worked as Tahsildar Gajuwaka during the period from 1-6-2016 to 26-5-2017 AN.I have since retired from service on 31-5-2019 on attaining superannuation.</p>
                    <p>Point No.2. With regard to the reasons for issuing an erroneous Income Certificate to Sri Moturu Mahalakshmi Naidu Father of Harish in Income Certificate bearing Number AP111610174 Dated 
5-4-2017 with reference to the IT returns filed by him, I am to state that, as I have retired from Service, I contacted the Tahsildars Office Gajuwaka and enquired about the records of the Income Certificate referred by your Department. I was told that consequent to the formation of new Districts, all digital backup data pertaining to previous years upto 2021 were removed from the computer systems and hence they could not be retrieved for verification.</p>
                    <p>In the instant case the Income Certificate is given for Rs. 5,70,804 ( Rupees Five Lakhs Seventy Thousand and Eight Hundred and four ) The applicant as could be seen from the copies of the IT returns is a Steel Plant Employee and the information furnished by him for obtaining Income Certificate has been accepted as bonafide information at the time of enquiry by the Village Revenue Officer, Revenue Inspector and dealing Assistant in the Office and accordingly Income Certificate was issued in good faith to Sri Moturu Mahalakshmi Naidu father of Harish. Further we have no access to check the Income Tax Returns of Moturu Mahalakshmi Naidu in our Office at that Time. 
 
 I am to further state that the Income certificates are issued after due enquiry of material papers submitted by the applicants viz, Adhar Card, Ration Card, and Salary Certificates etc by the Village Revenue Officer concerned and counter checked by the Revenue Inspector and concerned dealing Assistant in the Office. Gajuwaka is an Urban Mandal and we used to get a huge number of applications for issue of Caste, Native and Income Certificates. Due diligence is exercised while issuing the certificates.</p>
                    <p>Hence I am to state that the Income Certificate was issued to Moturu Mahalakshmi Naidu, Father of Harish, based on the material papers submitted by the applicant, and on the basis of the recommendations of the Village Revenue Officer, Mandal Revenue Inspector and dealing Assistant in good faith.</p>
                    <p>Point No.3 In regard to the general procedure for issuance of Income Certificates I am to state that, as per procedure in vogue in 2017, the applicant seeking Income Certificate, has to submit Identity Proof, Residential Proof, and declare his income in the application along with proof of income if he is a salaried employee, and has to submit the application in a Mee Seva Center. On receipt of the application through Internet and physical application, the concerned VRO picks up the application, conducts enquiry, and write his recommendation on the application, and then it is counter checked and countersigned by the Mandal Revenue Inspector concerned, and the connected file will be prepared by the dealing Assistant and sent for the digital signature of the Tahsildar. After Digital signing of the Certificate, a message will be flashed to the applicant in the Mee Seva Portal to Collect the Certificate from the Mee Seva Center where the application was filed. If the application is not in order or found to be ineligible at any stage of the enquiry the same will be rejected and it is informed to the applicant with reasons as envisaged in the Mee Seva guidelines.</p>
                    <p>I am to state if any individual obtains an Income Certificate based on incorrect documents, they are liable for punishment under relevant sections of Law.</p>
                    <p>This information has been furnished to you with reference to your letter cited and it may kindly be acknowledged.</p>
                    <p>Yours faithfully</p>
                    <p>K.V.S.Ravi
 Tahsildar (Retired)</p>
